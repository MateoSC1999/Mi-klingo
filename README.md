# Mi-klingo application, created for the Eskasoni Revserve.

This version of the application is not complete as is missing the Node Modules, audio files and backend is not connected to the database "MongoDb".
This application was meant to be run on the Saint Mary's university server, as the backend is using old credential for this server.
